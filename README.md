old project from a long time ago that was refactored

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder

### `yarn eject`

 It will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them
